# Trading System Proof of Concept
This is a simple trading system based on Kafka for event sourcing, .Net Core 2 for server side processing (order book / matching end) and Socket.IO for client-side streaming.

To test this project:
1) run the script "build-docker-images.sh" (needs docker > v17)
2) run the script "run.sh"

Access your localhost:5000 via browser and have fun!
